### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with experience developing full stack web applications. I've built projects using React, Rails, and a variety of web technologies. You can see some of them in my pinned repositories.

I'm proficient in JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and C, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and make an impact.
